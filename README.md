This is a place to organize any small programs that are used for decayspec.  This way we can easily add code we find useful here and don't have to worry about loosing small bits here and there or having to create an entire repo for each.



  * Efficiency Grapher : Takes it ROOT files and figures how the Efficiency of the array.  Needs work to be used past its initial use case.

  * Smear_geant4_hist_energy : Takes in a ROOT file generated from Geant4 and processed to add a gaussian smear to the energies/bins.
